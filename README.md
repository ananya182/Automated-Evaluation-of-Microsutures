# Automated-Evaluation-of-Microsutures
Automated evaluation of micro-suturing would lead to efficient, fast and unbiased training of a trainee neurosurgeon. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness (final image) of micro-suturing using various classical computer vision algorithms like Canny edge detection, Gaussian filtering, thresholding etc.
